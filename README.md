## An Open Source Advanced Control Line Timer Project

Climb and Dive is an open source DIY project to create your own advanced timer for an electric powered control line model aircraft.  How advanced?  How about an active, governor timer with wireless programming!  Utilizing an inexpensive microcontroller development board in conjunction with an add-on circuitboard the timer is compact, light-weight and very simple to make and use.   Without opening any hatches or disconnecting any plugs the timer can be quickly programmed at the flying field using a Bluetooth application on your smartphone.  Because itâ€™s open source, you can customize the functionality to your liking or even add new features.

## Project Philosophy

This project is a progression of the original basic Touch and Go timer.  I wanted to combine all of the positive features of other timers into one compact unit.  The target user group for this timer is first time beginners to novice flyers all the way up to more advanced stunt flyers.  It's still intended to adhere to the basic KISS principle; minimal components, built-in safety features and simple to make and operate without overly complex programming requirements.  I also wanted it to be easy as possible to change settings at the field without having to purchase or use any other attachments.

## Instructions

All of the assembly, programming and operating instructions can be found in the instruction manual on the document pages, [www.circuitflyer.com](https://circuitflyer.com/Climb_and_Dive/)  The program files can be downloaded from within the web pages or from the release tab above.
