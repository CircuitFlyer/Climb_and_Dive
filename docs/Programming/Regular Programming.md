## Programming Without a Wireless Connection ##

A limited set of programming parameters can also be changed without a Bluetooth connection.  The Delay Time, Flight Time and RPM can be changed as follows:

**Step 1** - 5 taps on the pin to enter the programming mode â€“ the LED will change to yellow (Program Start Delay)

**Step 2** - To move between the three available programming modes:<br>

1 tap for Program Start Delay (yellow)<br>
2 taps for Program Flight Time (cyan)<br>
3 taps for Program RPM (magenta)<br>



**Step 3** - To change a setting while in the programming mode:

*Program Start Delay (yellow):*  Touch and hold the pin.  After a short delay the LED will flash.  Count the number of flashes.  Each flash = 1 second of delay.  Release the pin when you reach the desired count.

*Program Flight Time (cyan):*  Touch and hold the pin.  After a short delay the LED will flash.  Count the number of flashes.  Each flash = 10 seconds of flight time.  Release the pin when you reach the desired count.

*Program RPM (magenta):*

{: .warning }
You are about to run the motor at its flight RPM, secure the aircraft and stay clear of the prop.  The next thing to always remember: **3 TAPS TO STOP THE MOTOR**.

To start the motor, touch and hold the pin.  The LED will flash quickly to warn of the impending start-up.  After a short delay the motor will start and accelerate to the last programmed flight RPM.  Release the pin and the motor will stay running.

While the motor is running:<br>
1 tap on the pin will increase the RPM by 50 RPM.<br>
2 taps will decrease the RPM by 50 RPM.<br>  

Be sure to wait about a second between each set of taps for the RPM to change. Use a tachometer for a more precise setting of the RPM.  Avoid prolonged running on the ground as some electrical components may get hot.

When the desired RPM is reached:<br>
**3 TAPS TO STOP THE MOTOR.**<br>

**Step 4** - 4 taps to exit the programming mode and return to Standby (green).  Any new settings you enter will automatically be saved to memory and used for subsequent flights.
