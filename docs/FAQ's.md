## Frequently Asked Questions ##

**Does the Climb_and_Dive work with any ESC?**  The timer does requires an ESC with a built in BEC (battery eliminator circuit).  Other than that, the timer should work with just about any ESC but there may be some rare ESC's out there that may not be compatible.

**Can I extend the touch sensor pin?**  Yes, in theory.  You will have to experiment to make sure it works reliably, but you can add a wire to the touch sensor pin to extend the ‘sensor’ to another location.

**Why don't I get the  one second throttle blip when I start the timer?**  If your ESC has a procedure for throttle calibration, try that, it may help.  See [ESC Information](Power System Information#ESC Information).

**Is a Bluetooth wireless connection allowed in competition?**  The Bluetooth radio is turned on *only* while the timer is in the programming mode.  Therefore the Bluetooth connection cannot be construed as to provide any control of the aircraft during flight.  Bluetooth is 2.4GHz spread spectrum technology.  The timer uses low energy Bluetooth transmitted through a very small onboard antenna which limits it's usefull range to about 30 feet, or 10 meters, maximum.

**Is Bluefruit Connect the only app that will work with the timer?**  No, there are plenty of other free Bluetooth apps that support wireless UART communication.  Bluefruit Connect was suggested for its simplicity and ease of use.

**What type of solder do you use for the backpack PCB assembly?**  The backpack components are soldered with a lead-free synthetic no-clean formula solder paste.

**What is bootout.txt on the `CIRCUITPY` drive?**  This a small text file is automatically generated by CircuitPython.  It includes information on which version of CircuitPython is installed as well as details about the microcontroller board.

**What is CircuitPython?**  CircuitPython is Adafruit's fork of the MicroPython programming language.  Micropython is a subset of instructions derived from Python specifically for use on microcontrollers.  CircuitPython is well supported and a tonne of information can be found in various [Adafruit learning guides][2].

**Can I make changes to the program code?**  Yes, Adafruit and CircuitPython make it easy.  If you are making minor changes, open code.py in any text editor program, like Notebook or TextEdit.  Make your changes and then save it as code.py back onto the `CIRCUITPY` drive.  As soon as the code is saved the program re-boots and your new code starts running.  If you would like to make more substantial changes then I would suggest a free code editing program like [Mu Editor][1].  The [Adafruit Learning Guides][3] cover everything you need to know.
