## Bill of Materials ##

Complete project kits can be purchased on Tindie.  Each kit comes complete with the program code already installed and  the circuitboards fully tested.

If you prefer to purchase items separately here are some suggested sources:

| Qty | Description | Online Sources |
| :---: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Seed Studio Xiao nRF52840<br>(The cheaper one, not the 'Sense' version) |  |
| 1 | Climb_and_Dive Backpack |  |
| 1 | Right Angle Header Strip, 5 position | [Sparkfun][3]<br>[Adafruit][4] |
| 1 | JST Battery Connector (Optional) | |

## Tools Required ##

Electronic soldering equipment; soldering iron, flux and solder.  These are available from numerous sources online.  If you need to brush-up on your electronics soldering skills there are some good tutorials on [Adafruit][1] and [Sparkfun][2].

## Assembly ##

The boards as supplied include strips of breakaway header pins.  Solder as shown in the photos below.  Be careful to orient the boards correctly as shown.


When connecting the ESC be sure the connector ground wire (brown or black) is attached to the ground pin on the board.  Connect the backpack motor pins to any two of the three motor wires.  For convenience I use a JST battery style connector (for reference the correct manufacturers name is a JST-RYC connector).

Cut the header pins as shown.
